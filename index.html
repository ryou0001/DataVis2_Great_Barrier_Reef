              Great Barrier Reef exist in tension with the economic 
              realities of the area.</div>

              <div style="column-count: 2;column-fill: balance; widows: 2; font-size:16px">
                The Great Barrier Reef Region describes an area 
                that includes the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park 
                and six Natural Resource Management (NRM) Regions. 
                <p>
                Most residents of the Great Barrier Reef Region live
                in population centres along the Queensland coastline. 
                Cairns and Townsville are the largest of these centres. 
                <p>
                A survey conducted in 2017 sought to find out residents' feelings
                both about the Great Barrier Reef, and threats to the Reef.

      <div class="residents_2col">
        <div class="values_text" style="column-count: 2;column-fill: balance;font-size:16px">
          Residents tended to speak positively of the Great Barrier 
          Reef, with the overwhelming majority strongly agreeing with
          the statement "I love that I live beside the GBR". 
          <p></p>
          More than 94% of residents had visited the Great Barrier Reef before,
          and more than 87% had visited at least once in the previous twelve months.

        </div>
        <div class="words_text_A" style="column-count: 2;column-fill: balance;font-size:16px">
          When residents were asked to list the first words that come to mind
          when they think of the Great Barrier Reef, the most common words were
          positive adjectives such as <b style="color: palevioletred">beautiful</b> 
          and <b style="color: palevioletred">beauty</b>, 
          as well as nouns associated with the reef such as 
          <b style="color: goldenrod">coral</b> and 
          <b style="color: goldenrod">fish</b>. 
          <p>
            However, it was also common for residents to report more negative words 
          and phrases such as <b style="color: red">bleaching</b> 
          and <b style="color: red">endangered</b>. Many residents also gave the
          words <b style="color: green">tourism</b> and <b style="color: green">tourist</b>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="words_text_B" style="column-count: 2;column-fill: balance;font-size:16px">
          Residents were also asked to list what they thought to be the three biggest
          threats to the Great Barrier Reef. Researchers took these responses and created
          categories. The ten categories that were mentioned the most are shown in the 
          bar chart below.  
        </p>We will focus on <b>climate change</b>, <b>mining</b> and <b>tourism</b>.

          The word cloud shows common phrases residents associate with 
          the Great Barrier Reef. Phrases in large font are more common, 
          phrases in small font are less common.
          <p>By looking at phrases, certain patterns become clear. For example,
            <b>coral</b> is a common word as residents associate <b>coral</b> 
            and <b>corals</b> with the reef, but also <b>coral bleaching</b>.

      <!----Jobs in the GBR region---->
      <div class="residents_jobs">
        <div class="jobs_text">
          Jobs in the Great Barrier Reef region  tend to follow a similar pattern to jobs in Australia. 
          No one job type goes beyond 12% of the region's jobs.
          Australia's top 3 most common job types, <b>Health care and social assistance</b>, 
          <b>Retail trade</b>, and <b>Education and training</b> all appear as top 5 most common 
          job types for the region. 
          <b>Accommodation and food services</b> and <b>Construction</b>
          also appear in Australia's top 10 most common job types. 
          <p>
           However, when two less common job types are examined - <b>mining</b> and <b>tourism</b> - 
            the tensions of the region become clear.

        <div class="mining_text" style="columns: 2; column-fill: balance;">
          Almost thirty thousand jobs in the Great Barrier Reef Region are 
          in mining, comprising more than 4% of total jobs. 
          This may seem like a small percentage, but mining jobs make up less than 2% of jobs in 
          Queensland, and an even smaller percantage of jobs in Australia. 
          Thus mining is an important employer in the region. 
          <p>Contrast this with the fact that 16% of residents think that 
            mining is a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.

            Sixty thousand jobs are supported by marine tourism.<a href="#section1">[1]</a> 
            If all these jobs are concentrated in the Great Barrier
            Reef region, that would mean more than 8% of total jobs 
            are supported by tourism. 

            <p>Tourism to the region is concentrated to 7% of the 
              total Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. 86% of tourism 
              occurs in the waters around Cairns, Port Douglas, and 
              the Whitsundays.<a href="#section1">[1]</a>

            <p>Residents are concerned that tourism is a threat to
              the Great Barrier Reef. Understandably, areas that see
              more tourists tended to have higher concern. 

            <p>The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is divided into 
              four managment areas, that do not correspond to the 
              NRM Regions in which residents live. Tourist data is 
              broken down by the management areas. Cairns/Cooktown, 
              which includes the waters around Cairns, and 
              Townsville/Whitsunday, which includes the waters around
              the Whitsundays, are the most popular tourist destinations.

            <p>The residents' survey occurred in 2017. Since then, 
              Queensland closed its borders twice in response to the 
              global pandemic. During the closures, tourism numbers 
              dropped. Tourist visits have not yet returned to pre-pandemic 
              numbers.

              Residents listed climate change as one of their biggest concerns,
              second only to pollution. 
              
              <p>Climate change is indeed threatening
              the Great Barrier Reef, as rising sea water temperatures are 
              causing mass coral bleaching events. Multiple Great Barrier Reef
               bleaching events have occurred in the past ten years, 
               including in 2016, 2017, 2020, and 2022. 
               Each mass bleaching event corresponds to higher than average 
               ocean temperatures.
